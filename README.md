# Singularity Technical Documentation

## Overview:

Singularity is a decentralized community focused on Collaborations, Concepts, Collectives, and Creatives (4C). All documentation is stored as Markdown files, managed in Obsidian, and editable under the /docs branch in this Git repository. Visualizations and organizational structures are dynamic and interconnected in an Obsidian graph-like manner.

## Singularity App Network System:

We are currently developing a Singularity App Network System that will revolutionize the 4C experience. Here's a sneak peek into what it will offer:

1. **Download Singularity App:**
   - Soon, you will be able to download the Singularity App from your app store.

2. **Event Management:**
   - Scan flyers, add events, and seamlessly connect with friends using NFC, WiFi, or Bluetooth.

3. **Artist Profiles and Collectives:**
   - Create and manage artist profiles, connect with collectives, and showcase your creative endeavors.

4. **Event Publication Workflow:**
   - Add new events locally and automatically inform relevant collectives via email.
   - Events will be published for all users upon collective approval.
